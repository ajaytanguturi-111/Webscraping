 Scrape top headlines from a news website
This Python script scrapes the latest top headlines from the India Today homepage and saves them to a headlines.txt file for offline viewing or further analysis. The script uses the requests library to fetch the website's HTML content and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract news headlines from h2 tags. All collected headlines are stored in a plain text file named headlines.txt. A lightweight and automated way to collect news headlines from a public website for personal use, data collection, or content analysis.
